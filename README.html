#Structjour, A Journal Helper for Day Traders

This saves me some hours per day with regards to documenting my trades. However, it is currently limited to my personal needs.

Structjour will read the DAS Pro export of the trades window, transform it to csv format, and then place the ouput (Excel/CSV file containing sorted transactions) on the page.

Structjour will then prompts for an image for each trade, placing the image on the page next to relevant information.

At _version 0.0.1_, the structural components are not yet in places. Only the basic functions are working at the moment.

My plans for _version 1.0_ is for Structjour to be a console app which will interrogate the user for needed trade information like stops, targets, open trades, strategy, etc. It may also add input platforms, beginning with IB statements (html, csv, xlsx) as well as incorporate other input from DAS, e.g. the position window export or IB to figure open trades without asking. In short, the priority is functionality for reviewing trades for me and users who use DAS Pro or Interactive Brokers. 

_Version 2.0_ will be a windowed application or possibly a web-hosted application at [ZeroSubstance](http://www.ZeroSubstance.com). The problem with the web version is how to avoid pulling in clients' sensitive data.  

_Version 3_ will be enhanced by database functionality to save and regurgitate information on demand.</p>

My purpose for creating this application are: 
  1. Documenting trades is time consuming but necessary. This saves time and allows me to focus on the trade, not the procedure.
  2. The code will be open-source for now. It is too soon to decide if there is any commercial potential, but I cannot ruled it out. 
  3. I am planning to the code to my compadres at BearBulls first and, hopefully, get use cases and usability suggestions. This code is also available here on Github.

This project is great learning opportunity for me and I have enjoyed it so far. The list of things I am learning is long and growing everyday.

Also, the experience gained from this could open up opportunities for other programming gigs.
