	<strong>Structjour, A Journal Helper for Day Traders</strong>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
	This saves me some hours per day with regards to documenting my trades.
	However, it is currently limited to my personal needs.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
	<strong>Structjour</strong>
	will read the DAS Pro export of the trades window, transform it to csv
	format, and then place the output (Excel/CSV file containing sorted
	transactions) on the page.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
	<strong>Structjour</strong>
	will then prompts for an image for each trade, placing the image on the
	page next to relevant information.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
	At <em>version 0.0.1</em>, the structural components are not yet in places.
	Only the basic functions are working at the moment.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
	My plans for <em>version 1.0</em> is for <strong>Structjour</strong> to be
	a console app which will interrogate the user for needed trade information
	like stops, targets, open trades, strategy, etc. It may also add input
	platforms, beginning with IB statements (html, csv, xlsx) as well as
	incorporate other input from DAS, e.g. the position window export or IB to
	figure open trades without asking. In short, the priority is functionality
	for reviewing trades for me and users who use DAS Pro or Interactive
	Brokers.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
	<em>Version 2.0</em>
will be a windowed application or possibly a web-hosted application at	<a href="http://www.zerosubstance.com/" target="_blank">ZeroSubstance</a>.
	The problem with the web version is how to avoid pulling in clients'
	sensitive data.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
	<em>Version 3.0</em>
	will be enhanced by database functionality to save and regurgitate
	information on demand.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
	My purpose for creating this application are:
</div>
<ol>
	<li>
		Documenting trades is time-consuming but necessary. This saves time and
		allows me to focus on the trade, not the procedure.
	</li>
	<li>
		The code will be open-source for now. It is too soon to decide if there
		is any commercial potential, but I cannot rule it out.
	</li>
	<li>
		I am planning to the code to my compadres at BearBulls first and,
		hopefully, get use cases and usability suggestions. This code is also
		available here on Github.
	</li>
</ol>

<div>
	This project is a great learning opportunity for me and I have enjoyed it
	so far. The list of things I am learning is long and growing every day.
</div>
<div>
	Also, the experience gained from this could open up opportunities for other
	programming gigs.
